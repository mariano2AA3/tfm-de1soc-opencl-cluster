 Warning: Compile with "-g" to get line number, variable name, and additional loop information         

Kernels that do not use any work-item built-in functions, such as get_global_id(), are compiled for single
work-item execution (a task). Otherwise, a kernel is compiled as an ND-Range.

For tasks, the compiler will attempt to pipeline every loop in the kernel to allow multiple iterations of
the loop to execute concurrently. If some loops are not pipelined, or not pipelined well, you may not get
good performance.

For ND-Range kernels, the loops are not pipelined. Instead, they are built to accept multiple work-items
simultaneously. Kernel throughput is usually reduced by the largest total number of iterations of nested
loops. A large number of threads is usually required to efficiently utilize ND-Range kernels.
